Some Codes by KevinLeeeee
Hi There! Thanks for coming.
In the Branch named Statistics, you will find some codes about statistics.
The codes are to do some calculations including variance test and linear regression for (x, y).
Hope you may find them useful.
Please do remember to change the address of the files accordingly if they are loaded in the python program.
The examples are from chapter 8 of the textbook <概率论与数理统计教程>第三版,茆诗松,程依鸣等.
